## What is SophaxChat?

SophaxChat is an **open-source, infrastructure-free, end-to-end encrypted** iOS messenger. It works over Bluetooth LE and WiFi Direct — no internet required, no servers, no phone number, no account.

Every message is protected by the **Signal Protocol** (X3DH + Double Ratchet). Your identity is nothing more than a cryptographic key pair generated on your device.

### Why does it exist?

| Scenario | Signal | bitchat | SophaxChat |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| No internet connection | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| No phone number required | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Signal-grade forward secrecy | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Per-session unique keys (X3DH) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| No server dependency | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Open-source (including server) | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Multihop relay (mesh routing) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

SophaxChat occupies a specific niche: **Signal-grade cryptography, zero infrastructure**. Ideal for journalists, activists, protesters, disaster responders, or anyone in an environment where internet access is unavailable, monitored, or untrusted.

## Protocol

### Session Lifecycle

```
┌─ Alice ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Bob ─┐

  [1. DISCOVERY — MultipeerConnectivity (Bluetooth LE / WiFi Direct)]

      Alice ←──── MPC peer found ────→ Bob

  [2. HELLO — Immediate key exchange on connection]

      Alice ──── Hello(PreKeyBundle_A) ────→ Bob
      Alice ←─── Hello(PreKeyBundle_B) ──── Bob

  [3. SESSION INIT — X3DH key agreement, first encrypted message]

      Alice computes:
        DH1 = DH(IK_A, SPK_B)
        DH2 = DH(EK_A, IK_B)
        DH3 = DH(EK_A, SPK_B)
        DH4 = DH(EK_A, OPK_B)  [if available]
        SK  = HKDF(DH1 || DH2 || DH3 || DH4)

      Alice ──── InitiateSession(EK_A, usedKeyIDs, DR_msg_0) ────→ Bob
                                                         Bob derives SK from his keys
                                                         Bob inits Double Ratchet

  [4. MESSAGES — Double Ratchet (forward secrecy + break-in recovery)]

      Alice ──── Message(DR_msg_1) ────→ Bob
      Alice ←─── Message(DR_msg_2) ──── Bob
           ...

  [5. RELAY — If Alice and Bob not directly connected]

      Alice ──── Relay(TTL=6, target=Bob, msg) ────→ Charlie ────→ Bob
                                                     (TTL=5)

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Properties

- **Forward secrecy** — each message uses a unique message key derived via HMAC-SHA256. Compromising key `n` reveals nothing about keys `< n`.
- **Break-in recovery** — after a compromise, DH ratchet steps generate fresh key material from new Curve25519 ephemeral keys.
- **Multihop relay** — messages flood through the mesh with TTL=6, deduplicated via LRU cache. Alice can reach Bob through Charlie even without a direct link.
- **Offline queue** — messages queued in memory when no peers are reachable; drained automatically on reconnect.
- **Disappearing messages** — optional `expiresAt` timestamp; messages purged locally every 60 seconds.

## Cryptography

All primitives come from Apple's **[CryptoKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cryptokit)** — hardware-accelerated and independently audited by Apple.

| Layer | Operation | Algorithm | Key Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identity | Signing | Ed25519 | 256-bit |
| Identity | Key agreement | X25519 | 256-bit |
| Session init | Key exchange | X3DH | — |
| Session init | Key derivation | HKDF-SHA256 | 256-bit |
| Messaging | Symmetric ratchet | HMAC-SHA256 | 256-bit |
| Messaging | DH ratchet | X25519 | 256-bit |
| Messaging | AEAD encryption | ChaCha20-Poly1305 | 256-bit |
| Storage | At-rest encryption | AES-256-GCM | 256-bit |
| Identity verification | Safety numbers | SHA-512 | — |

### Key Storage

All private keys and session states are stored in the **iOS Keychain** with `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`:

- Not backed up to iCloud
- Not transferred to a new device
- Not accessible when the device is locked
- Wiped on device factory reset

## Getting Started

### Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Xcode | 15.0+ |
| iOS deployment target | 17.0+ |
| Physical devices | 2× iPhone (MultipeerConnectivity requires real hardware) |
| XcodeGen | latest |

> **Note:** The Swift core library (`SophaxChatCore`) builds without Xcode via `swift build`. Physical devices are only required to test P2P connectivity.

### Build

```sh
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/sophaxtechnologies/SophaxChat.git
cd SophaxChat

# 2. Install XcodeGen
brew install xcodegen

# 3. Generate Xcode project
xcodegen generate

# 4. Open in Xcode
open SophaxChat.xcodeproj
```

Then in Xcode:
1. Select your development **Team** in the project settings (Signing & Capabilities)
2. Choose a physical device as the build target
3. **⌘R** to build and run

Repeat on the second device.

### Verify the core library (no Xcode needed)

```sh
swift build
```

### Tests

```sh
# Run in Xcode (Swift Testing framework)
# Product → Test  (⌘U)
```

Tests cover: X3DH key symmetry (with/without OTPK), Double Ratchet bidirectional messaging, out-of-order message delivery, session state persistence, associated data binding, and KDF distinctness.

## Security

### What SophaxChat protects against

| Threat | Protection |
|---|---|
| Network eavesdropping | ChaCha20-Poly1305 E2EE; transport also encrypted (MPC `.required`) |
| MITM / impersonation | Ed25519 signatures on every message; Safety Number verification |
| Replay attacks | Unique nonce per message; message-ID deduplication at storage layer |
| Past message compromise | Forward secrecy via symmetric ratchet (per-message keys) |
| Future message compromise | Break-in recovery via DH ratchet (fresh Curve25519 ephemeral keys) |
| Session eavesdropping by relay | Inner message E2EE; relay nodes see envelope metadata only |
| Data at rest | AES-256-GCM per-conversation encrypted files |
| iCloud backup exfiltration | `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`; backup excluded |
| App Switcher screenshot | App content blurred on `UIApplication.willResignActiveNotification` |
| DoS via oversized messages | Input validation: message ≤ 64 KB, username ≤ 64 chars |
| Prekey exhaustion | OTPK pool auto-replenished when below 50%; SPK rotated every 7 days |

### Identity verification

Each user has a **Safety Number** — a 60-digit fingerprint derived from SHA-512 of their own identity keys, displayed as 12 groups of 5 digits. Both numbers are shown side by side in the verification screen: each party reads their own number aloud to the other. If both match on both devices, the connection is authentic.

### Known limitations (MVP)

These are architectural limitations that will be addressed in future releases:

| Limitation | Impact | Roadmap |
|---|---|---|
| No header encryption | Ratchet headers (key rotation events, message count) visible to relay nodes | v0.4 |
| No sealed sender | Sender peerID visible in wire envelope | v0.5 |
| No group messaging | 1:1 sessions only | v0.6 |
| No store-and-forward | Offline recipients miss messages (unless relayed via intermediate peer) | v0.6 |
| No independent audit | See responsible disclosure below | Planned |

### Responsible Disclosure

Do not open public issues for security bugs.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Before contributing:

1. Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — especially if touching crypto code
2. Open an issue to discuss significant changes before writing code
3. All cryptographic changes require a corresponding test in `CryptoTests.swift`
4. Run `swift build` before submitting

### Areas where help is especially welcome

- **UI/UX** — the interface is functional, not polished
- **Tests** — relay dedup, session initiation edge cases, offline queue
- **macOS port** — Catalyst bridge
- **Localization** — the app currently ships in English only
